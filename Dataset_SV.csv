the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it s wrong.
i don t feel like urban music s just been celebrated by [joss stone] winning or her being nominated  or by the brits acknowledging that there s an urban music scene because it s all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day.
she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban.
if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain  i think that s where you can call it urban - that s where this new sub-category  or uber-category  has come from.
what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background.
if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community  i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too.
if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (i think probably should include hip-hop  soul & funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the streets  although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim  she definitely deserved to win a prize  joss stone s albums are quite simply amazing  easily better than anything else that was released last year.
she did deserve it  but i agree with the comments about urban music.
if people want to call it urban  why not  if we really analysed it  the term  dance music  is misleading because it doesn t describe everything you can dance to.
excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely  i dont understand the point that ty is making.
stop puting it all in brackets and let s just call it music  and let s especially drop the black / urban tag - nearly all music came from black origin  this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour.
joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style  just as someone from an inner city  and indeed not from the usa could sing country music.
if that person was good at it and authentic in sound  would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style   the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed  in part  from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards.
the term  urban  therefore  has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first  black  or  white  thereby rendering the issue colourblind.
urban is just a word that s come about recently to describe  black  music that s become popular now.
the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black  same thing  with streets  amy winehouse  etc.
they are both 10 times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos   but why not brits      so what if joss stone won the urban awards.
her music is great soul and surely that is under the  urban  banner  what if the streets had won  would people be whining because mike skinner is white...
urban is pc version for saying black music.
urban is a nonsense term - music of black origin  well doesn t that include rock  music made in the inner cities  well almost all bands end up making music in london/manchester etc.
urban  seems to be the new name for all styles of black music.
joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery - what other reason do they need to award her the brit  all this  urban  and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored."

"brits debate over  urban  music joss stone  a 17-year-old soul singer from devon  beat dizzee rascal  jamelia  lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards.
the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it s wrong.
i don t feel like urban music s just been celebrated by [joss stone] winning or her being nominated  or by the brits acknowledging that there s an urban music scene because it s all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day.
she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban.
if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain  i think that s where you can call it urban - that s where this new sub-category  or uber-category  has come from.
what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background.
if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community  i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too.
if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (i think probably should include hip-hop  soul & funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the streets  although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim  she definitely deserved to win a prize  joss stone s albums are quite simply amazing  easily better than anything else that was released last year.
she did deserve it  but i agree with the comments about urban music.
if people want to call it urban  why not  if we really analysed it  the term  dance music  is misleading because it doesn t describe everything you can dance to.
excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely  i dont understand the point that ty is making.
stop puting it all in brackets and let s just call it music  and let s especially drop the black / urban tag - nearly all music came from black origin  this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour.
joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style  just as someone from an inner city  and indeed not from the usa could sing country music.
if that person was good at it and authentic in sound  would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style   the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed  in part  from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards.
the term  urban  therefore  has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first  black  or  white  thereby rendering the issue colourblind.
urban is just a word that s come about recently to describe  black  music that s become popular now.
the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black  same thing  with streets  amy winehouse  etc.
they are both 10 times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos   but why not brits      so what if joss stone won the urban awards.
her music is great soul and surely that is under the  urban  banner  what if the streets had won  would people be whining because mike skinner is white...
urban is pc version for saying black music.
urban is a nonsense term - music of black origin  well doesn t that include rock  music made in the inner cities  well almost all bands end up making music in london/manchester etc.
urban  seems to be the new name for all styles of black music.
joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery - what other reason do they need to award her the brit  all this  urban  and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored.","uk troops on ivory coast standby downing street has confirmed british troops are on standby in case they need to help evacuate several hundred uk citizens from ivory coast.

"call for action on internet scam phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet  rogue-dialling  scams  according to premium phone line regulator icstis.

phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for.
icstis spokesman rob dwight said:  phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner.

does any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised  the phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently  so are these people followed up and prosecuted    these diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal mp3s  porn and pirated software.
these scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them.
or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going   why don t bt et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer s request  to anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls.
he informed the phone company about it  they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers.
phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill  otherwise they d be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.
one example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid.
it s not the fault of phone companies  and at last they are doing something about it.

"roundabout continues nostalgia trip the new big-screen version of the magic roundabout  released in the uk on friday  is the latest attempt to turn children s television into box-office gold.
recent years have seen a less-than-successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbit s five children and it  previously filmed by the bbc in 1991.
the new version of the magic roundabout  which will be released as sprung!
dan jolin  reviews editor of empire magazine  says classic children s tv shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention.
what s next - the clangers on some distant planet  with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them   despite thunderbirds  disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (£22m) but only recouped $21m (£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating.
but then again  it couldn t be better than the original series  could it   it s always nice to see these old toons re-released  but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie (and the song!) i think i ve been completely put off.
as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series.
personally i d like to see cartoons such as transformers  thundercats and m.a.s.k. get full hollywood remakes.
leave them alone  why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place  the thunderbirds film was apalling  not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson.
part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect.
i have fond memories of bod (not least of which because i look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film.
it s all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a  new  audience  but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this  and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it.
it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice  but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood  they are never going to live up to expectation.
it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made  are film-makers running out of original ideas   all i can say is bring back danger mouse  probably the greatest kids  show ever.
again  like so many of these nostalgia programmes  the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original s cut out paper technique for inventiveness  and was woefully inadequate.
seems that the film and tv is doing the same now - it s just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them  rather than being daring and trying something new.
tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes  dj s are sampling or re-working 70 s and 80 s music.
it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today s film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia.
there are plany of modern children s book that would make excellent films or tv programmes  why not use them instead of rehashing the past   mr.
i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone  and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office  especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie  popular among children because it s original  witty  and modern.
the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago.
could morph hold his own in a big screen movie    or even jamie and the magic torch....hmmmmm  i could go on and on.
it s only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods  isn t it  i d hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation - i love that  done in a shed  clunkiness and you couldn t recreate the magic.
this re-gurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people s ideas  because it guarantees to bring in the $$$.","i can t say i was overly pleased at the fixture being played just after christmas   said o neill.

but are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously   when video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight - and to offer a warning.
an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time   wrote travis anderson  in texas.
some of the comments were humorous:  this game is so good i m not going to get it  there s no way i could limit the hours i d spend playing it   wrote charles macintyre  from england.
but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game (mmorpg):   you need to get out more  could be the motto of any mmorpg.
gaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession  whether it is spending too much time in the gym  in front of the television  or reading poetry.
however  stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent.
massively multiplayer online role playing games - mmorpgs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds.
e hayot  writing in the culture blogzine print culture  said recently:  i used to play the online role-playing game everquest a lot.
he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour  wasn t that unusual; lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much .
another correspondent wrote:  i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming  and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness.
the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game.
so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing..or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting   sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming  i find myself longing to have the time to join them.
i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct.
i play games a lot  definately over 20 hours a week  but i don t go missing work or other commitments in order to play games.
when you stop playing you re at the same point as when you started; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and  since you ve gained nothing in the real world  you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one.
obviously  somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem.
it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the pc game are  easier  and more fun than the real world.
i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games.
whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games  i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv.
i think i m obsessed with gaming in general  i spend far too much time playing games like everquest 2 and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to  i m always thinking in the back if my mind that i d rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united.

it s getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming  and enjoying  real  life...
having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking.

lord falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties.
to be protected from terror the government says  we must become a tyranny.
i agree with frederick forsyth.
yes  there has been oppression by the british government in the past  and overstepping the mark in places like ireland  but yes  we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge/trial etc.
forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism; 3000 people died in one morning in ny on september 11th 2001.
i agree  the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat; but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too.
mr forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions.
terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear  by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties.
i absolutely agree with frederick forsyth.
what is really worrying is the enthusiasm of mr blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear.
if the government has its way with id cards  tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not.
i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth.
i am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that british people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court.
the new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id cards and the linking of data bases  together with the un-british idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years.
an interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assured destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance.
2) the terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the london underground and we could do very little to stop it.
i don t usually have much time for mr forsyth s largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on.
as it stands terrorists do not need to attack the u.k. it s government will soon have it s people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs.
i ll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be saying that the government didn t do enough to protect the uk.
people like forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite new labour and tony blair.
i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth.
the very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live  is under attack  not from terrorists  but from this government.
the perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the  alleged  terrorists are doing  but from our own government.
mr forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten britain today are well aware that hitler  stalin  and the ira all failed.
but to meet the new threat  to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today s terrorists  we may need to do things a little differently.
frederic forsythe s comments seem to me to be a well-thought-out analysis of why we (human society as a whole  and britain in particular) should resist the temptation to over-protect through fear.
it s all very well criticising that policy  but if mr forsythe can t draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative  i say  so what   to his opinions.
this government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights.
if the government can hold  suspects  without charge or trial  what s next   i agree absolutely.
the single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose.
the british government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation.
although  in principle i agree with him  frederick forsyth fails to address one key point- al-qaeda attacks (though obviously there have been none yet in the uk) seek to kill the maximum number of people.
the british government is not going down the road that mr forsyth suggests.
sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny  even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the british people who have lived in a democracy protected by tony blair and others of like mind who  mr.
like new labour  he believed he was promoting the people s best interests.
but as forsythe criticises this government  hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians.
i agree with mr forsyth s views.
of course frederick is wrong about britain winning the war against the ira and he s wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny.
we  as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro us propaganda  which of course also means we ll inherit most  if not all of their total paranoia  and allow our governments  of any political persuasion incidentally  to gradually  and insidiously  impose a police state by well tried & tested back door methods.
this government  with much fanfare  signs us up to the european convention on human rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial.
like many of your respondents  i wouldn t usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views i share  but in the instance of opposing charles clark s proposals for house arrest  i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth/  i agree with mr forsyth.
i agree in many ways with what mr forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as zimbabwe and burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent  it is hypocrisy of the highest order.
mr forsyth links  islamic fundamentalism  to the new  threat .
the people who mr forsyth labels the new  threat  are those who do not follow the correct teachings of islam.
i accept that the intentions of these policies are to make britain a safer place but i cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in northern ireland internment certainly didn t achieve anything - the bombings didn t stop  and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the ira with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the british.
being eight years older than frederick forsyth and a survivor of the blitz on london  it is easy to agree with him  he is absolutely spot on."

"roundabout continues nostalgia trip the new big-screen version of the magic roundabout  released in the uk on friday  is the latest attempt to turn children s television into box-office gold.
recent years have seen a less-than-successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbit s five children and it  previously filmed by the bbc in 1991.
the new version of the magic roundabout  which will be released as sprung!
dan jolin  reviews editor of empire magazine  says classic children s tv shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention.
what s next - the clangers on some distant planet  with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them   despite thunderbirds  disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (£22m) but only recouped $21m (£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating.
but then again  it couldn t be better than the original series  could it   it s always nice to see these old toons re-released  but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie (and the song!) i think i ve been completely put off.
as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series.
personally i d like to see cartoons such as transformers  thundercats and m.a.s.k. get full hollywood remakes.
leave them alone  why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place  the thunderbirds film was apalling  not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson.
part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect.
i have fond memories of bod (not least of which because i look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film.
it s all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a  new  audience  but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this  and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it.
it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice  but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood  they are never going to live up to expectation.
it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made  are film-makers running out of original ideas   all i can say is bring back danger mouse  probably the greatest kids  show ever.
again  like so many of these nostalgia programmes  the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original s cut out paper technique for inventiveness  and was woefully inadequate.
seems that the film and tv is doing the same now - it s just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them  rather than being daring and trying something new.
tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes  dj s are sampling or re-working 70 s and 80 s music.
it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today s film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia.
there are plany of modern children s book that would make excellent films or tv programmes  why not use them instead of rehashing the past   mr.
i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone  and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office  especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie  popular among children because it s original  witty  and modern.
the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago.
could morph hold his own in a big screen movie    or even jamie and the magic torch....hmmmmm  i could go on and on.

and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen  he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing  but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan.
there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield - and he had a busy summer  overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard.
he said:  they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes  but the response to real madrid was the same - steven is not for sale.

i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he d like to do anything else.
it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a £30m-plus bid in the summer - but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen.
parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool s new stadium in stanley park  which is set to open in 2007.
on the subject of possible new investment  parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor  with rumours of interest from the middle east.

as for the stadium  if it gets us cash what difference does it make really   £50m for gerrard  i don t care who you are  the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be.
through a cleverly worded statement  the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself  which i think is the right thing to do.
parry s statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players."

recent years have seen a less-than-successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbit s five children and it  previously filmed by the bbc in 1991.
the new version of the magic roundabout  which will be released as sprung!
dan jolin  reviews editor of empire magazine  says classic children s tv shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention.
what s next - the clangers on some distant planet  with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them   despite thunderbirds  disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (£22m) but only recouped $21m (£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating.
but then again  it couldn t be better than the original series  could it   it s always nice to see these old toons re-released  but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie (and the song!) i think i ve been completely put off.
as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series.
personally i d like to see cartoons such as transformers  thundercats and m.a.s.k. get full hollywood remakes.
leave them alone  why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place  the thunderbirds film was apalling  not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson.
part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect.
i have fond memories of bod (not least of which because i look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film.
it s all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a  new  audience  but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this  and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it.
it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice  but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood  they are never going to live up to expectation.
it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made  are film-makers running out of original ideas   all i can say is bring back danger mouse  probably the greatest kids  show ever.
again  like so many of these nostalgia programmes  the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original s cut out paper technique for inventiveness  and was woefully inadequate.
seems that the film and tv is doing the same now - it s just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them  rather than being daring and trying something new.

and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen  he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing  but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan.
there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield - and he had a busy summer  overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard.
he said:  they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes  but the response to real madrid was the same - steven is not for sale.

as for the stadium  if it gets us cash what difference does it make really   £50m for gerrard  i don t care who you are  the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be.
through a cleverly worded statement  the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself  which i think is the right thing to do.

what s next - the clangers on some distant planet  with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them   despite thunderbirds  disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (£22m) but only recouped $21m (£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating.
but then again  it couldn t be better than the original series  could it   it s always nice to see these old toons re-released  but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie (and the song!) i think i ve been completely put off.
as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series.
personally i d like to see cartoons such as transformers  thundercats and m.a.s.k. get full hollywood remakes.
leave them alone  why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place  the thunderbirds film was apalling  not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson.
part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect.
i have fond memories of bod (not least of which because i look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film.
it s all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a  new  audience  but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this  and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it.
it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice  but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood  they are never going to live up to expectation.
it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made  are film-makers running out of original ideas   all i can say is bring back danger mouse  probably the greatest kids  show ever.
again  like so many of these nostalgia programmes  the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original s cut out paper technique for inventiveness  and was woefully inadequate.
seems that the film and tv is doing the same now - it s just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them  rather than being daring and trying something new.
tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes  dj s are sampling or re-working 70 s and 80 s music.
it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today s film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia.
there are plany of modern children s book that would make excellent films or tv programmes  why not use them instead of rehashing the past   mr.
i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone  and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office  especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie  popular among children because it s original  witty  and modern.
the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago.
could morph hold his own in a big screen movie    or even jamie and the magic torch....hmmmmm  i could go on and on.
it s only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods  isn t it  i d hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation - i love that  done in a shed  clunkiness and you couldn t recreate the magic.
this re-gurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people s ideas  because it guarantees to bring in the $$$.","krispy kreme shares hit shares in krispy kreme doughnuts have taken a dunking on wall street after the firm revealed it would have to restate its 2004 financial reports.

"franz man seeks government help franz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos has called for more government help for musicians  while taking part in an edinburgh lectures discussion.
if they can fund football  why not fund music   areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants  so why not music  we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music.
the government has enough problems funding schools and health services.
if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that.
yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.
as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move.
the government shouldn t  fund  music - it should  invest  in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.
i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies!
yeah  why not  music should be government funded  particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff.
pop music pretty much rules the earth  so more attention should go to the other fraternities  i agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer.
the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations  like save the music in the us.","halo 2 has proved popular online  with gamers notching up a record 28 million hours playing the game on xbox live.

the trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt  which will grow in 10 years  by conservative estimates  to more than half the nation s total annual output.
this upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government  putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business.

lord falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties.
to be protected from terror the government says  we must become a tyranny.
i agree with frederick forsyth.
yes  there has been oppression by the british government in the past  and overstepping the mark in places like ireland  but yes  we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge/trial etc.
forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism; 3000 people died in one morning in ny on september 11th 2001.
i agree  the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat; but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too.
mr forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions.
terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear  by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties.
i absolutely agree with frederick forsyth.
what is really worrying is the enthusiasm of mr blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear.
if the government has its way with id cards  tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not.
i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth.
i am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that british people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court.
the new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id cards and the linking of data bases  together with the un-british idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years.
an interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assured destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance.
2) the terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the london underground and we could do very little to stop it.
i don t usually have much time for mr forsyth s largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on.
as it stands terrorists do not need to attack the u.k. it s government will soon have it s people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs.
i ll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be saying that the government didn t do enough to protect the uk.
people like forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite new labour and tony blair.
i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth.
the very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live  is under attack  not from terrorists  but from this government.
the perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the  alleged  terrorists are doing  but from our own government.
mr forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten britain today are well aware that hitler  stalin  and the ira all failed.
but to meet the new threat  to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today s terrorists  we may need to do things a little differently.
frederic forsythe s comments seem to me to be a well-thought-out analysis of why we (human society as a whole  and britain in particular) should resist the temptation to over-protect through fear.
it s all very well criticising that policy  but if mr forsythe can t draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative  i say  so what   to his opinions.
this government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights.
if the government can hold  suspects  without charge or trial  what s next   i agree absolutely.
the single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose.
the british government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation.
although  in principle i agree with him  frederick forsyth fails to address one key point- al-qaeda attacks (though obviously there have been none yet in the uk) seek to kill the maximum number of people.
the british government is not going down the road that mr forsyth suggests.
sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny  even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the british people who have lived in a democracy protected by tony blair and others of like mind who  mr.
like new labour  he believed he was promoting the people s best interests.
but as forsythe criticises this government  hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians.
i agree with mr forsyth s views.
of course frederick is wrong about britain winning the war against the ira and he s wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny.
we  as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro us propaganda  which of course also means we ll inherit most  if not all of their total paranoia  and allow our governments  of any political persuasion incidentally  to gradually  and insidiously  impose a police state by well tried & tested back door methods.
this government  with much fanfare  signs us up to the european convention on human rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial.
like many of your respondents  i wouldn t usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views i share  but in the instance of opposing charles clark s proposals for house arrest  i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth/  i agree with mr forsyth.
i agree in many ways with what mr forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as zimbabwe and burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent  it is hypocrisy of the highest order.
mr forsyth links  islamic fundamentalism  to the new  threat .
the people who mr forsyth labels the new  threat  are those who do not follow the correct teachings of islam.
i accept that the intentions of these policies are to make britain a safer place but i cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in northern ireland internment certainly didn t achieve anything - the bombings didn t stop  and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the ira with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the british.
being eight years older than frederick forsyth and a survivor of the blitz on london  it is easy to agree with him  he is absolutely spot on."
"minimum wage increased to £5.05 the minimum wage will rise in october  benefiting more than 1m people  the government has announced.
the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999.
according to the commission  many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage  challenging .
unveiling the latest increase  mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a  symbol of decency and fairness .
the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage.
a £3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for 16 to 17-year-olds  but apprentices are exempt.
the trade unions congress welcomed the increase  but has called for a £6 minimum wage by next year.
this was only 2 years ago and i was getting paid £2.75 an hour  and working as hard as any of the older staff  maybe it s about time 16 - 21 year olds got a fair wage!
we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad.
still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it.
however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them:  would you be happy to work for less than £5.05 an hour  .
also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you  it s about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldn t go a miss either.
if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it s not being run properly and if it folds  a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people  so everybody wins except incompetent business owners!
the increase in minimum wage is a good thing.
hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level  and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard  but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.
i work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic  catering & portering etc - pay the minimum wage of £4.85 as the basic rate.
good strategy isn t it   although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase  its timing stinks.
by increasing overheads  for business  there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt  or that pair of trainers for next to nothing.
this is great news  but that might be because i work for minimum wage.
the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business.
the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase  thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses  it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the  lower status  jobs.
i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won t take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping  or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door   i don t believe in the minimum wage at all!
a minimum wage just makes people complacent.
i might add  that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation  people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages.
as a graduate working for minimum wage  i welcome any increase of pay i can get.
as an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional £5000 per year.
on the contrary mr blair wins - he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well.
if the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the £6.00 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt - namely mine.
blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage.","ec calls truce in deficit battle the european commission (ec) has called a truce in its battle with france and germany over breaching deficit limits.

so  will the sega - espn range be missed  a key reason for answering  yes  is that liking or disliking a sports game regularly comes down to personal taste  and having some options available always proves hugely handy.
on the same note  the espn 2k5 and ea sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players  personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements.
the espn games are a touch more arcade-like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into  although like their rivals  they also offer a dizzyingly-extensive array of in-game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die-hard of sports fans."

"what the election should really be about  a general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy.

they will be asked which of the top five issues  including the pension issue  they would support.
before 1997 most pensioners voted conservative.
but there is no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time around.
pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of adair turner s full report into the issue.
we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent  but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraq.

we will seek to get pledges from individual mps and would-be mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports.
we would like the support of political parties but i think a general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electors.

"minimum wage increased to £5.05 the minimum wage will rise in october  benefiting more than 1m people  the government has announced.
the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999.
according to the commission  many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage  challenging .
unveiling the latest increase  mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a  symbol of decency and fairness .
the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage.
a £3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for 16 to 17-year-olds  but apprentices are exempt.
the trade unions congress welcomed the increase  but has called for a £6 minimum wage by next year.
this was only 2 years ago and i was getting paid £2.75 an hour  and working as hard as any of the older staff  maybe it s about time 16 - 21 year olds got a fair wage!
we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad.
still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it.
however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them:  would you be happy to work for less than £5.05 an hour  .
also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you  it s about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldn t go a miss either.
if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it s not being run properly and if it folds  a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people  so everybody wins except incompetent business owners!
the increase in minimum wage is a good thing.
hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level  and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard  but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.
i work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic  catering & portering etc - pay the minimum wage of £4.85 as the basic rate.
good strategy isn t it   although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase  its timing stinks.
by increasing overheads  for business  there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt  or that pair of trainers for next to nothing.
this is great news  but that might be because i work for minimum wage.
the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business.
the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase  thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses  it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the  lower status  jobs.
i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won t take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping  or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door   i don t believe in the minimum wage at all!
a minimum wage just makes people complacent.
i might add  that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation  people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages.
as a graduate working for minimum wage  i welcome any increase of pay i can get.

does any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised  the phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently  so are these people followed up and prosecuted    these diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal mp3s  porn and pirated software.
these scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them.
or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going   why don t bt et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer s request  to anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls.
he informed the phone company about it  they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers.
phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill  otherwise they d be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.
one example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid.
it s not the fault of phone companies  and at last they are doing something about it.
how about an automatic monthly cap of say £20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted  that way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage."

i play games a lot  definately over 20 hours a week  but i don t go missing work or other commitments in order to play games.
when you stop playing you re at the same point as when you started; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and  since you ve gained nothing in the real world  you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one.
obviously  somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem.

recent years have seen a less-than-successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbit s five children and it  previously filmed by the bbc in 1991.
the new version of the magic roundabout  which will be released as sprung!
dan jolin  reviews editor of empire magazine  says classic children s tv shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention.
what s next - the clangers on some distant planet  with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them   despite thunderbirds  disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (£22m) but only recouped $21m (£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating.
but then again  it couldn t be better than the original series  could it   it s always nice to see these old toons re-released  but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie (and the song!) i think i ve been completely put off.
as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series.
personally i d like to see cartoons such as transformers  thundercats and m.a.s.k. get full hollywood remakes.
leave them alone  why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place  the thunderbirds film was apalling  not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson.
part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect.
i have fond memories of bod (not least of which because i look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film.
it s all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a  new  audience  but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this  and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it.
it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice  but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood  they are never going to live up to expectation.
it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made  are film-makers running out of original ideas   all i can say is bring back danger mouse  probably the greatest kids  show ever.
again  like so many of these nostalgia programmes  the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original s cut out paper technique for inventiveness  and was woefully inadequate.
seems that the film and tv is doing the same now - it s just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them  rather than being daring and trying something new.
tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes  dj s are sampling or re-working 70 s and 80 s music.
it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today s film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia.
there are plany of modern children s book that would make excellent films or tv programmes  why not use them instead of rehashing the past   mr.
i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone  and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office  especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie  popular among children because it s original  witty  and modern.
the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago.
could morph hold his own in a big screen movie    or even jamie and the magic torch....hmmmmm  i could go on and on.
it s only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods  isn t it  i d hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation - i love that  done in a shed  clunkiness and you couldn t recreate the magic.
this re-gurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people s ideas  because it guarantees to bring in the $$$."

the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it s wrong.
i don t feel like urban music s just been celebrated by [joss stone] winning or her being nominated  or by the brits acknowledging that there s an urban music scene because it s all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day.
she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban.
if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain  i think that s where you can call it urban - that s where this new sub-category  or uber-category  has come from.
what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background.
if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community  i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too.
if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (i think probably should include hip-hop  soul & funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the streets  although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim  she definitely deserved to win a prize  joss stone s albums are quite simply amazing  easily better than anything else that was released last year.
she did deserve it  but i agree with the comments about urban music.
if people want to call it urban  why not  if we really analysed it  the term  dance music  is misleading because it doesn t describe everything you can dance to.
excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely  i dont understand the point that ty is making.
stop puting it all in brackets and let s just call it music  and let s especially drop the black / urban tag - nearly all music came from black origin  this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour.
joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style  just as someone from an inner city  and indeed not from the usa could sing country music.
if that person was good at it and authentic in sound  would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style   the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed  in part  from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards.
the term  urban  therefore  has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first  black  or  white  thereby rendering the issue colourblind.
urban is just a word that s come about recently to describe  black  music that s become popular now.
the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black  same thing  with streets  amy winehouse  etc.
they are both 10 times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos   but why not brits      so what if joss stone won the urban awards.
her music is great soul and surely that is under the  urban  banner  what if the streets had won  would people be whining because mike skinner is white...
urban is pc version for saying black music.
urban is a nonsense term - music of black origin  well doesn t that include rock  music made in the inner cities  well almost all bands end up making music in london/manchester etc.
urban  seems to be the new name for all styles of black music.
joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery - what other reason do they need to award her the brit  all this  urban  and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored."

that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in 1969  the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team.
a ferocious game at the arms park in 1972 was edged 19-16 by the all blacks  a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn james-inspired lions of 1971.
new zealand defeated a wales xv 12-3 at the arms park in a non-cap game in 1974  but it was the 1978 game in cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries.

"new consoles promise big problems making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money  an industry conference has been told.
but numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists  and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop.
according to robert walsh  head of brisbane-based game developer krome studios  next generation games will cost between $10-25m to make  with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title.
mr walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the sony psp and the nintendo ds  since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games.
mr wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game.
new development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games  and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference.
even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago  so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices.
the game developers conference included a special two-day summit dedicated to creating mobile games.

the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999.
according to the commission  many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage  challenging .
unveiling the latest increase  mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a  symbol of decency and fairness .
the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage.
a £3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for 16 to 17-year-olds  but apprentices are exempt.
the trade unions congress welcomed the increase  but has called for a £6 minimum wage by next year.
this was only 2 years ago and i was getting paid £2.75 an hour  and working as hard as any of the older staff  maybe it s about time 16 - 21 year olds got a fair wage!
we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad.
still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it.
however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them:  would you be happy to work for less than £5.05 an hour  .
also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you  it s about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldn t go a miss either.
if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it s not being run properly and if it folds  a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people  so everybody wins except incompetent business owners!
the increase in minimum wage is a good thing.
hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level  and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard  but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.
i work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic  catering & portering etc - pay the minimum wage of £4.85 as the basic rate.
good strategy isn t it   although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase  its timing stinks.
by increasing overheads  for business  there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt  or that pair of trainers for next to nothing.
this is great news  but that might be because i work for minimum wage.
the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business.
the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase  thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses  it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the  lower status  jobs.
i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won t take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping  or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door   i don t believe in the minimum wage at all!
a minimum wage just makes people complacent.
i might add  that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation  people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages.
as a graduate working for minimum wage  i welcome any increase of pay i can get.
as an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional £5000 per year.
on the contrary mr blair wins - he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well.
if the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the £6.00 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt - namely mine.
blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage."

lord falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties.
to be protected from terror the government says  we must become a tyranny.
i agree with frederick forsyth.
yes  there has been oppression by the british government in the past  and overstepping the mark in places like ireland  but yes  we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge/trial etc.
forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism; 3000 people died in one morning in ny on september 11th 2001.
i agree  the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat; but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too.
mr forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions.
terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear  by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties.
i absolutely agree with frederick forsyth.
what is really worrying is the enthusiasm of mr blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear.
if the government has its way with id cards  tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not.
i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth.
i am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that british people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court.
the new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id cards and the linking of data bases  together with the un-british idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years.
an interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assured destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance.
2) the terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the london underground and we could do very little to stop it.
i don t usually have much time for mr forsyth s largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on.
as it stands terrorists do not need to attack the u.k. it s government will soon have it s people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs.
i ll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be saying that the government didn t do enough to protect the uk.
people like forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite new labour and tony blair.
i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth.
the very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live  is under attack  not from terrorists  but from this government.
the perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the  alleged  terrorists are doing  but from our own government.
mr forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten britain today are well aware that hitler  stalin  and the ira all failed.
but to meet the new threat  to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today s terrorists  we may need to do things a little differently.
frederic forsythe s comments seem to me to be a well-thought-out analysis of why we (human society as a whole  and britain in particular) should resist the temptation to over-protect through fear.
it s all very well criticising that policy  but if mr forsythe can t draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative  i say  so what   to his opinions.
this government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights.
if the government can hold  suspects  without charge or trial  what s next   i agree absolutely.
the single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose.
the british government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation.
although  in principle i agree with him  frederick forsyth fails to address one key point- al-qaeda attacks (though obviously there have been none yet in the uk) seek to kill the maximum number of people.
the british government is not going down the road that mr forsyth suggests.
sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny  even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the british people who have lived in a democracy protected by tony blair and others of like mind who  mr.
like new labour  he believed he was promoting the people s best interests.
but as forsythe criticises this government  hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians.
i agree with mr forsyth s views.
of course frederick is wrong about britain winning the war against the ira and he s wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny.
we  as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro us propaganda  which of course also means we ll inherit most  if not all of their total paranoia  and allow our governments  of any political persuasion incidentally  to gradually  and insidiously  impose a police state by well tried & tested back door methods.
this government  with much fanfare  signs us up to the european convention on human rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial.
like many of your respondents  i wouldn t usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views i share  but in the instance of opposing charles clark s proposals for house arrest  i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth/  i agree with mr forsyth.
i agree in many ways with what mr forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as zimbabwe and burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent  it is hypocrisy of the highest order.
mr forsyth links  islamic fundamentalism  to the new  threat .
the people who mr forsyth labels the new  threat  are those who do not follow the correct teachings of islam.
i accept that the intentions of these policies are to make britain a safer place but i cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in northern ireland internment certainly didn t achieve anything - the bombings didn t stop  and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the ira with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the british.
being eight years older than frederick forsyth and a survivor of the blitz on london  it is easy to agree with him  he is absolutely spot on."

i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct.
i play games a lot  definately over 20 hours a week  but i don t go missing work or other commitments in order to play games.
when you stop playing you re at the same point as when you started; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and  since you ve gained nothing in the real world  you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one.
obviously  somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem.
it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the pc game are  easier  and more fun than the real world.
i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games.
whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games  i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv.

recent years have seen a less-than-successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbit s five children and it  previously filmed by the bbc in 1991.
the new version of the magic roundabout  which will be released as sprung!
dan jolin  reviews editor of empire magazine  says classic children s tv shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention.
what s next - the clangers on some distant planet  with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them   despite thunderbirds  disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (£22m) but only recouped $21m (£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating.
but then again  it couldn t be better than the original series  could it   it s always nice to see these old toons re-released  but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie (and the song!) i think i ve been completely put off.
as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series.
personally i d like to see cartoons such as transformers  thundercats and m.a.s.k. get full hollywood remakes.
leave them alone  why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place  the thunderbirds film was apalling  not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson.
part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect.
i have fond memories of bod (not least of which because i look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film.
it s all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a  new  audience  but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this  and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it.
it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice  but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood  they are never going to live up to expectation.
it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made  are film-makers running out of original ideas   all i can say is bring back danger mouse  probably the greatest kids  show ever.
again  like so many of these nostalgia programmes  the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original s cut out paper technique for inventiveness  and was woefully inadequate.
seems that the film and tv is doing the same now - it s just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them  rather than being daring and trying something new.
tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes  dj s are sampling or re-working 70 s and 80 s music.
it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today s film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia.
there are plany of modern children s book that would make excellent films or tv programmes  why not use them instead of rehashing the past   mr.
i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone  and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office  especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie  popular among children because it s original  witty  and modern.
the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago.
could morph hold his own in a big screen movie    or even jamie and the magic torch....hmmmmm  i could go on and on.
it s only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods  isn t it  i d hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation - i love that  done in a shed  clunkiness and you couldn t recreate the magic.
this re-gurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people s ideas  because it guarantees to bring in the $$$."

"brits debate over  urban  music joss stone  a 17-year-old soul singer from devon  beat dizzee rascal  jamelia  lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards.
the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it s wrong.
i don t feel like urban music s just been celebrated by [joss stone] winning or her being nominated  or by the brits acknowledging that there s an urban music scene because it s all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day.
she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban.
if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain  i think that s where you can call it urban - that s where this new sub-category  or uber-category  has come from.
what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background.
if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community  i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too.
if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (i think probably should include hip-hop  soul & funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the streets  although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim  she definitely deserved to win a prize  joss stone s albums are quite simply amazing  easily better than anything else that was released last year.
she did deserve it  but i agree with the comments about urban music.
if people want to call it urban  why not  if we really analysed it  the term  dance music  is misleading because it doesn t describe everything you can dance to.
excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely  i dont understand the point that ty is making.
stop puting it all in brackets and let s just call it music  and let s especially drop the black / urban tag - nearly all music came from black origin  this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour.
joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style  just as someone from an inner city  and indeed not from the usa could sing country music.
if that person was good at it and authentic in sound  would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style   the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed  in part  from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards.
the term  urban  therefore  has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first  black  or  white  thereby rendering the issue colourblind.
urban is just a word that s come about recently to describe  black  music that s become popular now.
the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black  same thing  with streets  amy winehouse  etc.
they are both 10 times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos   but why not brits      so what if joss stone won the urban awards.
her music is great soul and surely that is under the  urban  banner  what if the streets had won  would people be whining because mike skinner is white...
urban is pc version for saying black music.
urban is a nonsense term - music of black origin  well doesn t that include rock  music made in the inner cities  well almost all bands end up making music in london/manchester etc.
urban  seems to be the new name for all styles of black music.
joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery - what other reason do they need to award her the brit  all this  urban  and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored.","douglas set for indian adventure actor michael douglas is to co-produce and star in an adventure film about a diamond robbery set in india.

lord falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties.
to be protected from terror the government says  we must become a tyranny.
i agree with frederick forsyth.
yes  there has been oppression by the british government in the past  and overstepping the mark in places like ireland  but yes  we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge/trial etc.
forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism; 3000 people died in one morning in ny on september 11th 2001.
i agree  the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat; but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too.
mr forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions.
terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear  by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties.
i absolutely agree with frederick forsyth.
what is really worrying is the enthusiasm of mr blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear.
if the government has its way with id cards  tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not.
i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth.
i am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that british people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court.
the new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id cards and the linking of data bases  together with the un-british idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years.
an interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assured destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance.
2) the terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the london underground and we could do very little to stop it.
i don t usually have much time for mr forsyth s largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on.
as it stands terrorists do not need to attack the u.k. it s government will soon have it s people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs.
i ll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be saying that the government didn t do enough to protect the uk.
people like forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite new labour and tony blair.
i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth.
the very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live  is under attack  not from terrorists  but from this government.
the perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the  alleged  terrorists are doing  but from our own government.
mr forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten britain today are well aware that hitler  stalin  and the ira all failed.
but to meet the new threat  to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today s terrorists  we may need to do things a little differently.
frederic forsythe s comments seem to me to be a well-thought-out analysis of why we (human society as a whole  and britain in particular) should resist the temptation to over-protect through fear.
it s all very well criticising that policy  but if mr forsythe can t draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative  i say  so what   to his opinions.
this government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights.
if the government can hold  suspects  without charge or trial  what s next   i agree absolutely.
the single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose.
the british government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation.
although  in principle i agree with him  frederick forsyth fails to address one key point- al-qaeda attacks (though obviously there have been none yet in the uk) seek to kill the maximum number of people.
the british government is not going down the road that mr forsyth suggests.
sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny  even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the british people who have lived in a democracy protected by tony blair and others of like mind who  mr.
like new labour  he believed he was promoting the people s best interests.
but as forsythe criticises this government  hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians.
i agree with mr forsyth s views.
of course frederick is wrong about britain winning the war against the ira and he s wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny.
we  as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro us propaganda  which of course also means we ll inherit most  if not all of their total paranoia  and allow our governments  of any political persuasion incidentally  to gradually  and insidiously  impose a police state by well tried & tested back door methods.
this government  with much fanfare  signs us up to the european convention on human rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial.
like many of your respondents  i wouldn t usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views i share  but in the instance of opposing charles clark s proposals for house arrest  i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth/  i agree with mr forsyth.
i agree in many ways with what mr forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as zimbabwe and burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent  it is hypocrisy of the highest order.
mr forsyth links  islamic fundamentalism  to the new  threat .
the people who mr forsyth labels the new  threat  are those who do not follow the correct teachings of islam.
i accept that the intentions of these policies are to make britain a safer place but i cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in northern ireland internment certainly didn t achieve anything - the bombings didn t stop  and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the ira with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the british.
being eight years older than frederick forsyth and a survivor of the blitz on london  it is easy to agree with him  he is absolutely spot on."
